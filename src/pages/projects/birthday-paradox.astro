  description:
    'An interactive web application that demonstrates the Birthday Paradox through real-time simulations and probability visualizations.',
  fullDescription: `The Birthday Paradox Simulator is an educational web application that brings one of probability theory's most counterintuitive concepts to life. The simulator demonstrates how in a room of just 23 people, there's approximately a 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday - a result that often surprises people when they first encounter it.

This interactive tool allows users to run multiple simulations with different parameters, watching as empirical results converge toward theoretical probability. The application features dual visualizations: a probability convergence graph showing how results approach theory over iterations, and a complete birthday paradox curve displaying probabilities for different group sizes.

The simulator serves as both an educational tool and a practical demonstration of how our intuition about probability can be misleading, with applications extending to cryptography, hash functions, and collision detection in computer science.`,
