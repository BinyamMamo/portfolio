    'A mobile-first web application that delivers science-backed approaches to mental wellness through engaging, bite-sized interactions with TikTok-like scrollable interface.',
  fullDescription: `MindWave is a revolutionary mental wellness application that combines micro-habit building, engaging visual feedback, and quick relief tools in a familiar TikTok-like scrollable interface. The app delivers science-backed approaches to mental wellness through bite-sized, engaging interactions designed for modern attention spans.

The application features fractal visualizations that grow as users complete micro-habits, creating a satisfying visual representation of progress and neural pathway development. With its mobile-first design and focus on micro-interactions lasting 15-30 seconds, MindWave makes mental wellness accessible and engaging for users of all backgrounds.

Built with modern web technologies, MindWave emphasizes user privacy by storing all data locally, requiring no backend infrastructure or user authentication for the MVP version.`,
